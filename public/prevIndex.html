        <p>
          Refcode is a curriculum to introduce beginners to coding. It is put on by the Refugee Career Hub as part of
          their computer literacy program. After going through this curriculum, students will learn the basics of how to
          build a website, and students will know a little bit about what working as a professional developer is like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students will learn to use the tools that professional developers use to create websites. In this course,
          students will be introduced to Atom (an IDE or code editor), Chrome Inspect tools, GitHub Desktop, Cyberduck
          (an
          FTP client), and Freenom.com (a domain registrar).
        </p>
        <p>
          In this class we will learn about the strategies, workflows, and tools that professionals use to stay
          organized, communicate, and manage their time. We will learn about Agile Methodology, stand-up meetings,
          sprint
          cycles, kanban boards (with Trello), Slack chat, GitHub, and pair-programming.
          Each student will work towards creating a personal website by the end of the class. The student will register
          their own domain name and upload it to a web hosting server (provided by Refugee Career Hub).

          <p>
            The Refcode Level 1 class gives refugees and immigrants a glimpse of what a career in software engineering would look like.
            In addition to teaching students to build and code a website, students learn to use industry tools like GitHub, Slack, an IDE, and browser dev tools.
            They also learn important strategies mindsets and soft skills such as how to solve problems, how to use online references and resources, where to go for help, how to ask questions.

          <h1>Mentorship</h1>
          <p>
            Completing the class is just the beginning. Graduates interested in pursuing a career are matched with a mentor experienced in the field who can provide further guidance and direction for next steps.
            Whether that means applying to a school, studying a free online curriculum, building projects at home, or interviewing for that first developer job, mentors are prepared to give encouragement and
            leverage their own networks and experience on behalf of their mentees.

          <h1>TeamCode</h1>
          <p>
            It has been said that 70% of growth and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% comes from collaboration, and only 10% comes from traditional education.
            If that is true, then this program gets participants to 90%. Building a website on your own is challenging, but contributing to a team project is exponentially more difficult.
            The core of TeamCode is collaboration and communication. Graduates who join as contributors hone these skills by building a real-world project together as part of an agile team using GitHub, a project board, and Slack.
            Contributors define and scope the work and assign tasks during sprint planning meetings and simultaneously assemble a working website following principles of Atomic Design.

            I served in Iraq with the US Army, where we used locals who were our interpreters.
            During this class I met a couple of people who worked as interpreters for the US military in Afghanistan.
            It was great to be able to give back to those guys, who often were in the same dangerous situations we were in since they accompanied us on our missions.

            I love coding in general and getting to share my knowledge. This is such a unique place. Students are literally from all over the world from all different backgrounds.
            Every day is very interesting!

            When I was first learning how to code a lot of people helped me out and I got a lot of support from the community and that’s why I’m a programmer now,
            so I wanted to be involved and help out and try to share all the benefits that I”ve gotten from the Atlanta community. In the past couple weeks at the weekend labs I enjoyed watching the students start to help each other. They’ll say “Hey, how did you build that?
            Can you show me?” Seeing them progress from “How do I figure something out” to being able to teach others how to figure things out has been the most fun part.
            I feel excited for this community that we’re able to be a part of -- new programmers that we’re helping build and support.

            I am learning so fast! I came from Ethiopia and I didn’t have any coding experience, but after I came here--all of the students--we can publish our websites!
            That’s the most important thing. It’s result oriented. There are tutors here, and they show us how to get information.
            Before I didn’t have the experience, but after they taught me, I know how to get information. Now I will get it easily, on Google or YouTube, just like that.
