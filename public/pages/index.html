      <p>
        We need people who care about refugees and immigrants to join
        the community to help make it a success. Most classes have more
        than two volunteers for every student! That's because our
        students need a lot of support. You don't need to be a
        professional software engineer to help, there lots of ways to
        give your time and be a part of this amazing group of people.

        on Wednesday nights! It's free, and you get to join the

        We are seeking businesses able to take on a small cohort of
        our graduates as software engineering apprentices. Our graduates
        are motivated, smart, and eager to put everything they have
        learned into practice. Refcode will provide a plan to ensure the
        apprentices have the best chance at success during their
        apprenticeship, as well as support and guidance for both
        apprentices and the people at your company they are working with.

        One of the most challenging disadvantages that recent immigrants face
        when looking for work is the lack of a professional network. Refcode
        participants have the opportunity to connect with dozens of people who
        already have well-established professional networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refcode is a community as much as anything else. We are professional
        software engineers, code bootcamp students, self-learners, teachers,
        refugees, first-, second-, and seventh-generation immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that you can't learn to code and find your way to a
        software career on your own. You need support, encouragement,
        mentorship, coaching, advice, and a shoulder to cry on.

      <h3>Introduction to Coding Class</h3>
      <p>A 10 week course to introduce beginners to the professional tools, skills, and practices. This class is designed to help students discern their interest and aptitude in pursuing a career in software engineering. Class is run in an agile environment and prioritizes personal tutoring and just-in-time teaching. Students hear various software professionals talk about their own journeys into coding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <h3>Teamcode Project</h3>
      <p>Participants join a cohort of other graduates to work together on a real project in an environment set up similar to an agile software company. Students become contributors and work through a backlog of tickets, gaining valuable communication and collaboration skills.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <h3>Education or Training program</h3>
      <p>At this point, participants are ready to dive into an educational program with confidence. Participants receive personal coaching to identify the best program to join, and whether they are starting a degree in computer science or a coding bootcamp, they will continue to be supported by Refcode mentors and the community throughout their study.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <h3>Apprenticeship</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, education is not enough. Employers are looking for real-world experience in even "entry level" positions. Refcode has partnered with organizations to create an apprenticeship opportunity that gives real experience working on real projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="step last">
      <h3>Entry Level Software Job</h3>
      <p>Getting to this point is not easy, and even though we have laid out a rough path, there is no single road to success and no program can certify that someone is ready to become a software engineer. But with tenacity, support, and a lot of work, it is possible!</p>
