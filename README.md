# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project also uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

In order to get set up to run this project you will need to run the following commands after cloning the repository the first time:

```
npm install
git lfs install
```

Once you've run those two commands, the repository should be ready to run using the commands below.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
